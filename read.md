This branch, the main branch, is a completely umodified version of the game. All modifications are stored in the branches.

The primary purpose of this repo is not getting the mod for yourself, it is for development and experimentation. That being said, any branch labeled (STABLE) is a viable build of the game. You will need to do the following to actually play the actual build:

FOR WINDOWS:
- OWN BALATRO (this repo is intentionally missing vitial files)
- DOWNLOAD AND EXTRACT STABLE BRANCH
- INSTALL 7-ZIP (https://www.7-zip.org/)
- LOCATE BALATRO's EXE (NOT the shortcut. If you've found the shortcut, left-click -> show more options -> open file location)
- OPEN BALATRO EXE WITH 7-ZIP
- COPY BALATRO CODE TO A ZIP FILE (This is your back-up in case you want to go back to vanilla)
- DRAG CONTENTS OF THE STABLE BRANCH INTO 7-ZIP

Note: in unstable branches, modifications are pushed often. This is because the laptop I'm coding on does not have Balatro on it. I use this repo as a quick way to port experimental code to my desktop. This is why you should never download from an unstable branch! The code may not ever have been complied before!
